Apprentice Rules
----------------
Apprentices are students, team members and friends, but they are not perfect and aren't expected to be. Here are a few rules:

* Take responsibility for your career goals
* Listen and share your desires, needs, and ask questions
* Incorporate feedback given, otherwise you will not grow
* Make time for interaction
* Have realistic expectations and approach the relationship with honesty
